                        <p>• Designed "MTPool" as an end-to-end joint framework for graph structure learning, temporal convolution, graph representation learning, and graph coarsening.</p>
                        <p>• Proposed a novel pooling method, "Variational Pooling." The centroids for cluster assignments are input-related to the input graphs, making the model more inductive and leading to better performance.</p>
                        <p>• Conducted extensive experiments on MTS benchmark datasets, and the empirical results prove that the proposed method's performance is better than state-of-the-art models in most cases.</p>

                        <p>• Used transfer entropy to extract the causality among time series and construct the TE graph. A CNN structure is used to comprehensively extract the time series features, which are used as node features in the TE graph.</p>
                        <p>• Conducted extensive experiments on MTS benchmark datasets, and the results from the experiment have proved that TEGNN out-performs the state-of-the-art models.</p>
